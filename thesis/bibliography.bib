  abstract = "In this paper, we consider a use case for national border control and management involving the assurance of privacy and protection of personally identifiable information (PII) in a shared multi-tenant environment, i.e. the cloud. A fuzzy searchable encryption scheme is applied on a watch list of names which are used as indexes for the identification files that are in their turn encrypted and stored on the cloud. Two propositions are described and tested in this paper. The first entails the application of a chaotic fuzzy searchable encryption scheme directly on the use case and its subsequent verification on a number of phonetics synonyms for each name. In the second version, a metaphone based chaotic fuzzy transformation method is used to perform a secure search and query. In this latter case, the fuzzy transformation is performed in two stages: the first stage is the application of the metaphone algorithm which maps all the words pronounced in the same way to a single code and the second stage is the application of the chaotic Local Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to the code words. In both the first and second propositions, amplification of the LSH is also performed which permits controlled fuzziness and ranking of the results. Extensive tests are performed and experimental results show that the proposed scheme can be used for secure searchable identification files and a privacy preserving scheme on the cloud.",

This paper discusses the interaction techniques it uses for smooth visual exploration of thousands of time series. We also describe design decisions behind the application and lessons learned in creating an application that makes do-it-yourself data mining popular. The prime lesson, it is hypothesized, is that an information visualization tool may be fruitfully viewed not as a tool but as part of an online social environment. In other words, to design a successful exploratory data analysis tool, one good strategy is to create a system that enables "social" data analysis. },
